Storing Data is time-consuming. So to speed up the process I implemented a prototype that can take input from this smart calculator and save it on cloud DB for future use. The main goal of this system is that you can easily integrate with any application where data is in terms of quantity so that the initial storing process is faster.

**FUNCTIONALITIES** 

- Online And Offline Calculations
- Connect to CloudDB
- Push And Fetch Data from CloudDB

**FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS**

- Connect
- Push
- Fetch
- DBToT
- Clear
- Close
- Numbers & Operators

1. Connect:

   Its purpose is to establish a connection with the Aws Database. So each of your Entries should be secure and accessible easily. Make sure before doing any data manipulation with the database first press the button to access all the functionalities smoothly.

2. Push:

   This button used to store the data on the database by taking input from the textfield and user phone number to integrate them.

3. Fetch:

   This button helps to fetch the data from the database.

4. DBToT:

   By pressing the button you can get the total sum of any particular field.

5. Clear:

   It helps to clear the textfield or any unwanted data visible on it.

6. Close:

   Its helps to close the application and terminate the operations.

7. Numbers & Operators:
